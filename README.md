# vissom-client - smartphone client application for Visualize Somerville 2.0

**Visualize Somerville** is a concept to combine technology and community into a large scale interactive installation in May, 2016. You will be able to interact with the projections via your smartphone or tablet to control what is on the walls. Imagine 30+ people all controlling different factors of the projections, painting on the walls, and making amazing art collectively.
