# vissom-client - smartphone client application for Visualize Somerville 2.0

**Visualize Somerville** is a concept to combine technology and community into a large scale interactive installation taking place on May 7, 2016. You will be able to interact with the projections via your smartphone or tablet to control what is on the walls. Imagine 30+ people all controlling different factors of the projections, painting on the walls, and making amazing art collectively.
